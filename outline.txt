NaNoWriMo 2015 - Andy Modell

Prompt: "A society where blood type and social status are somehow linked"

Backstory: Some food born illness, <illness>, somehow infected the 'upper-class' with a disease that requires consistent blood transfusions.  A pill has recently come out that, if taken daily, will delay the need for such transfusions.

Main character: <main> a young man who has just graduated pharmacy school and will be working at <pharma>.  Both parents are well-off lawyers, <mother> presented a case before the supreme court to make encrypted communications a right (famous), <father> worked for <pharma> as a patent attorney on some medicine that prevented the growth of cancer cells.

Friend: Jake somebody <main> grew up with who will be going to work at a company producing self-driving cars.

Romance: <girl> is the daughter of <pharma>'s CEO.  She recently got her law degree and will be working in the division that <father> now heads.  Starts on the same day as <main>.

Villain: <pharma> is a large profit driven corporation.  Their claim to fame comes as an injection that, if taken annually, will actually stop the growth of cancerous cells completely.  They've already developed a cure for <illness>, but they'd rather establish something more profitable.

Conflict: <main> eventually learns that <pharma> has come up with a cure to <illness>, and wants to make it known.  <pharma> is very unethical and tries to stop him.  Eventually, he ends up getting <girl> involved because <pharma>'s CEO doesn't notice that <main> is the person giving his company trouble.


Outline:

1. Introduce characters and world
     <main> has just graduated school.  We're at graduation with Jake and Jake's family.
     <mother> works for the EFF-style lobby.  <father> has `retired`, but he still does work with <pharma>
     Jake is going into tech.
     <main> is jealous of Jake's dad because worked at Microsoft back in the days of Bill Gates.
     <father> will comment on how proud he is of <main> for going to work at <pharma>.  Mention a `top secret` project he's been working on which is <daily pill>.
     Random other stuff about the dinner and the supreme brownie sunday desert.

2. Talk about the <illness>.
Begin this chapter by mentioning something about the housing that <main> and Jake are in where they can pack.  Note that it's a primarily Blood Type A community.  Then go into mentioning why it matters.
   People began noticing the death of farm-raised salmon in the US and UK.
   Ended up effecting, in general, the more wealthy who could afford the fish as opposed to traditional meets
   virus that doesn't show symptoms for three months
   Causes an auto-immune problem where people's antibodies begin to target their own blood.
   Transfusions of unaffected's blood seems to put it off for a short time.
   Social groups tended to focus around people with their own blood type.
   The megawealthy actually hired personal doners.
   Those with the AB and O blood types shared interesting situations.


Later:
- <main> finds out that <pharma> actually had a cure for <illness>
- <main> ends up hiding first with a gang who matches his blood type, but then <pharma>'s group ends up `getting` him.
- <girl> ends up hiding <main> at her house.  <ceo> doesn't really know about what <main> looks like, so it's alright.
- <girl> doens't end up knowing <main>'s blood type, so she has to end up giving him a transfusion of hers
- turns out <main> is really AB+, so he doesn't die even though girl is B+.
- <girl> and <main> end up figuring out a way to leak the data from <ceo> and the FBI comes in to investigate.  The data leaked ends up allowing the <mirical pill> to get mass produced and the epedemic is over!
